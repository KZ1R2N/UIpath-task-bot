I have tried to build three Robots with different tasks. 
Robot 1: copies the data from three Excel sheets named cars1.xlsx, cars2.xlsx, and cars3.xlsx and paste the value with the cars1 header attribute in the newcar.xlsx file. 
Robot 2: Input every raw data into the earlier created Microsoft Form link and press submit. 
Robot 4: Input every raw data into the earlier created Microsoft Form link, input value "1" into the value-added field, and press submit. It does not submit already submitted value.
